# EUREC4A python tools

This package aims to be a small collection of useful tools for the analysis of EUREC4A. There has been some discussion if this package should exist at all, because it might lead to a lock-in into python regarding the ease of use of EUREC4A-data and also many of the tools we are developing and using should not be EUREC4A exclusive. Thus, at least for now, we try to keep this package fairly minimal.
